## [21.1.8]

### Added
* (NeoForge only) A `TeamBasesPortalEvent` event is now posted when players walk into a team bases portal
  * Cancelling with `event.cancelWithReason(textComponent)` will prevent portal usage and display the reason to the player
  * Can be used to e.g. require the player has a game stage or has completed a quest

### Fixed
* Fixed behaviour when force-disbanding teams, particularly when players are offline
  * Was failing to archive base if `/ftbteams force-disband` is run when all team players are offline
  * Now ensures all players in the team (even if offline) are sent back to the lobby on next login (and inventory cleared if appropriate)
  * Also added `/ftbteambases archive verify` to archive any orphaned bases (i.e. where the team can't be found) that are detected
